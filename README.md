## Project Definition

### Introduction

This project consists of an implementation of the _ shoot development model written by Prusinkiewicz et al. (2004) and the L-System root growth model displayed in Leitner's et al (2010) paper, in order to output a graphical visualization of an entire plant, whose shape and size will rely on the imposed initial conditions.

### Justification

This project was arranged to facilitate future research efforts which require some sort of plant modeling, such as the simulation of ancient or extreme environments to infer the potential anatomical structure of plants.

## General Objectives

- Implement the root and shoot growth model which allows the inputting of different initial conditions.
- Create a set of graphical visualizations of the plant model from the imposed initial conditions.
- Set initial conditions based on real plant data to compare and contrast the obtained results and its real counterpart, in order to measure the performance and attunement of the model for future research projects.

## Used Tools

- Python 3.
- Processing 4.
